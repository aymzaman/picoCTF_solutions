To view the main function we can use the x function to view the memory https://visualgdb.com/gdbreference/commands/x
This command allowd to display the memory in different formats, in this case we would use the instructions format, 
x/100i main 100 specified the number of instructions we would get, main is the memory location we are examining 
We can now examine the main function and see what is it doing
we can see that our value 0x2262c96b is being saved at rbp-0x4.
we use that as our breakingpoint, we can then use the x/4xb $rbp-0x4, which would give us our flag
picoCTF{0x2262c96b}
