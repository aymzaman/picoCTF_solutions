In this challange we are tasked with finding the constant that is used to multiply with eax, using x to examine the memory of
the main functions we can see that there is another function call:
  0x401142 <main+38>:	call   0x401106 <func1>
So i set my next breakpoints at this address and we can see this code:
     0x401114 <func1+14>       imul   eax, eax, 0x3269
imul is multiplication is assambly, we are multiplying eax by 0x3269 and saving the result at eax, by converting the hex
into decimal we got out flag 12905
picoCTF{12905}
